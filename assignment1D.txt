There are alot of data quality issues is detected when we analyse the data. The most obvious data quality issue in this dataset is data missing value. There are quite alot of movie didn't state the film budget and their gross box office, some movie might not have actor 3 or even 2 so they left it blank. There are alot of movie didn't state their movie content rating, while color, director, director facebook's like, title year, and aspect ratio have very few missing value. Other than missing value, there are some attribute which their attribute name meaning is unclear. Attribute like color (which suppose to be color of movie), gross (might be means gross box office earned), and country (movie's country) which their attribute name might cause some confusion. There are also some row which the information are not insert according to the attribute (column). Example like the movie Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, the director name is inserted in the director_name and also num_critic_for_reviews column which it suppose to be insert in director_name column only and in the same row the information of movie_imdb_link also inserted in num_user_for_reviews, language, country, content_rating, and budget columns.
